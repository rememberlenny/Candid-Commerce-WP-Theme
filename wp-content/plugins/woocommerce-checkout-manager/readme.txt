= Removing fields =
Removing fields became easier now, all you have to do is tick which box or which boxes that you do not want to show on the checkout page and it will be removed.
Also you have the ability to not just remove the field alone but also remove the required (asterisk) attribute from the field. Leaving the field optional for the customer to fill out.

*Please Note that their is no need to tick both the remove field and remove required boxes.

= Receipt =
After the order is cleared, you the manager of the product gets a receipt and also the customer, now in the footer (which is the last thing someone sees on the receipt) you can customize that, and probably put your business address, or contact numbers, customer care numbers or even send best wishes and appreciation for the product they bought.

Request for adding new fields to the checkout page has been introduced. All you have to do is click the "Add New field" button and a drop down box will show allowing you to set the new field name which is "Label" and to set the example in the field which is "Placeholder."

* Placeholder allows the customer, the ability to get the feel of what exactly is this field about.
