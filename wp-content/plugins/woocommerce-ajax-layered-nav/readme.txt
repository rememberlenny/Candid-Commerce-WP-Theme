Desc:
The ajax-enabled, layered navigation extension for WooCommerce provides a richer user-experience for your customer 
and is particularly well-suited for stores that have a lot of variable products or products with a number of attributes. 
Not only does the layered navigation use ajax calls to reload content on the page, but the extension also provides a 
number of additional user-interface elements for the layered navigation, such as color swatches, size selectors and checkboxes.

Installation:
The Enhanced Layered Navigation extension installs just like any other wordpress plugin. Simply upload the zip file through your 
administration section and activate the plugin. Once activated, go to your widgets area and you should see a new widget called

Localization:
The text domain for the plugin is sod_ajax_layered_nav

Setup:
Once you’ve got the plugin setup and the new widget is showing up in your available widgets, go ahead and drag and drop and instance 
of the plugin into a sidebar area. Once you do this, you’ll be able to setup what type of layered navigation interface you’d like to use. 
You’ll have the option of: List, Color Selector, Size/Amount Selector, or Checkboxes. List and Checkboxes don’t have any additional options 
for setting them up other than query type and attribute, however Color Selector and Size/Amount Selector do and we'll now show you what the 
options for each one of those are
	
	Color Selector: 
	When you select Color Selector as the Display Type in the widget, you’ll be presented with color pickers for each of the 
	attribute values for that attribute. These color pickers define the swatches that you see on the frontend end.
	
	Size / Amount Selector: 
	When you select Size / Amount Selector as the Display Type in the widget, you’ll be presented with an input field for each 
	attribute value of the selected attributed. This lets you create selectable, user-friendly tags on the front end for a better 
	user experience. A good example of this might be sizes: Small = S, Medium = M, Large = L.
