SUMMARY:The Real-time Web with Node.js
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carlos Souza (Envy Labs), Jacob Swanner (Envy L
 abs). Building web applications is easy there are plenty of frameworks f
 or this. Building extremely fast and scalable web services is a much mor
 e difficult task, especially when you're dealing with hundreds of reques
 ts per second. This is where Node.js shines, providing the groundwork fo
 r real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

SUMMARY:Secrets of Awesome JavaScript API Design
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Brandon Satrom (Kendo UI). We know what good an
 d bad JavaScript APIs “feel” like, yet we struggle with designing the ki
 nds of APIs we enjoy using. The good news is that principles of good Jav
 aScript API design do exist, and it’s possible to find, if you know wher
 e to look. In this session, Brandon will introduce four API design princ
 iples, and walk through examples of these principles as seen in several 
 popular libraries.

SUMMARY:Getting Good: How to Integrate Novice Developers into Your Team
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Elise Worthy (Brandworthy). Good developer tale
 nt is hard to find. If you need to scale your team, what options do you 
 have? LivingSocial took an unconventional route and brought on 24 ruby n
 ovices for a 5 month developer bootcamp. The litmus test of the program 
 comes now that their development careers have started. What lessons can 
 be learned about integrating junior developers into existing teams with 
 legacy code?

SUMMARY:Evil Overlord's Tips for Being a Senior Developer
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carina C. Zona (See Do Teach). Hollywood super 
 villains learn their lessons the hard way. You don't have to. What can w
 e learn about doing good, from thwarted forces of doom? It's been said t
 hat coders "stand on the shoulders of giants." We'll take a session to s
 tand on the shoulders of legendary tyrants, get a view from their side, 
 & discover how to lead with the humor and grace that perpetually evades 
 those gals and guys.

SUMMARY:Secure RESTful API Automation with JavaScript
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jonathan LeBlanc (PayPal). Pragmatic RESTful AP
 I principles, along with a solid consumption architecture, can allow for
  a great amount of automation in your program development.  At the same 
 time, securing the application can be extremely tricky from JavaScript. 
  In this session we will explore the construction and usage of a secure 
 API interface using JavaScript.

SUMMARY:Benchmarking the New Front End: How to Quantify Single Page App 
 Performance
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Rachel Myers (ModCloth), Emily Nakashima (ModCl
 oth). There are lots of tools for tracking page load times — but as the 
 web goes mobile, applications get asynchronous, and functionality moves 
 to the browser, the meaning of “site performance” is changing. Most meas
 uring tools haven’t caught up yet. We’ll talk about how to measure your 
 users’ experiences beyond time to window load. #backbone #ember #html5 #

SUMMARY:Scraping the World with JavaScript
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Sylvain Zimmer (dotConferences). Crawlers and s
 crapers have been around for ages. However, being able to write them eas
 ily in JavaScript has been a significant advance in recent years because
  there is now little that a browser can do and a scraper can't. Brace yo
 urselves for the next chapter in the struggle between scrapers and data 
 protecters!

SUMMARY:Classical Inheritance is Obsolete: How to Think in Prototypal OO

 illa holding the banana and the entire jungle." — Joe Armstrong Learn ho

SUMMARY:Improving JavaScript Code Quality: Strategies and Tools
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ariya Hidayat (Sencha). The quality of JavaScri
 pt-based web applications can be improved by choosing the development st
 rategies which minimize common mistakes, avoid API ambiguities, and redu
 ce any syntax confusion. This talk highlights the recent developments on
  language tools which aim at solving near-future JavaScript quality anal
 ysis, from run-time complexity profiling to framework-aware static code 
 inspection.

SUMMARY:How To: Make Fast Design-Decisions as a Developer
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Julie Horvath (GitHub, Inc.). There are now app
 roximately 1 billion frontend frameworks, libraries, and tools to choose
  from when building web applications. It's easy to get stuck in the mud 
 while wading through resources to find what'll work best for you and you
 r team. As a designer and frontend dev at GitHub, a lot of my job is mak
 ing these decisions. Learn about the frontend arsenal of tools I use to 
 get there faster.

SUMMARY:More Than Good Design
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Sarah Mei (Pivotal Labs). Sometimes, you get a 
 team of really smart developers with extensive knowledge of software des
 ign...but together, they write terrible code. Why does this happen? How 
 can we avoid it? We'll deconstruct some bad JavaScript and start to reco
 gnize some of the invisible forces that guide our day-to-day software de
 sign decisions.

SUMMARY:Web Components: A Tectonic Shift for the Web Platform
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Eric Bidelman (Google). The declarative renaiss
 ance is upon us. Web Components (MDV, <template>, custom elements, Shado
 wDOM, mutation observers) are fundamentally going to change the way we b
 uild web apps. This session will introduce you to this brave new world o
 f web programming and discuss how to use web components, today.
