Overrides the current language and translates all messages into Pig Latin.

== Description ==

Checking if all the strings in your plugin or theme are translatable can be a tedious task. Pig Latin helps you
by translating all messages to [Pig Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin). For example *Edit  Pages* is translated to *Editay agesPay*.

Text in Pig Latin is both noticeably different than English and readable. This way you can spot strings, which aren't translatable, while the interface is stil usable.
